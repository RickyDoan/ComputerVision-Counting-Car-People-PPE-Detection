# Computer Vision Projects: Car Counter, People Counter, and PPE Detection

## Overview

### This repository demonstrates how to build and implement three computer vision applications using OpenCV and deep learning techniques:

* Car Counter - Detects and counts vehicles in a video stream using object detection.

* People Counter - Tracks and counts people appearing in a video frame.

* PPE Detection - Identifies whether individuals are wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as helmets and vests.

Implementation Details

### 1. Car Counter

- Concept :Vehicle detection and tracking is crucial in traffic management and smart surveillance systems. This project leverages deep learning-based object detection to track and count vehicles moving in a predefined region of interest.

- Preprocessing: The input video frame is read and preprocessed for better detection accuracy.

- Object Detection: A deep learning model (e.g., YOLO, SSD, or MobileNet) is used to detect vehicles.

- Tracking and Counting: Detected vehicles are assigned unique IDs and counted when they cross a specific region (e.g., a virtual line on the road).

- Output Processing: The count and tracking results are overlaid on the video output.

### 2. People Counter

- Concept : People counting is widely used in crowd monitoring, retail analytics, and security surveillance. This project utilizes deep learning-based object detection models to track individuals in a scene.

- Frame Processing: Video frames are loaded and processed to improve detection.

- Detection Model: A pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) is used to detect people in each frame.

- Tracking Mechanism: A tracking algorithm maintains the identity of individuals across frames to avoid double counting.

- Counting Logic: Individuals are counted when they pass a certain boundary or threshold.

### 3. PPE Detection

- Concept : In industrial and construction environments, ensuring safety compliance through PPE detection is essential. This project employs deep learning models to recognize safety gear, such as helmets and reflective vests.

- Dataset Preparation: Images containing people with and without PPE are used to train the model.

- Object Detection: A model trained on PPE-specific datasets (e.g., YOLO, TensorFlow Object Detection API) identifies individuals and classifies them based on the presence of safety gear.

- Violation Detection: If an individual is detected without proper PPE, the system can raise an alert or flag the violation.

* Key Takeaways

- Object detection models play a vital role in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, security, and workplace safety.

- Implementing these systems requires proper dataset preparation, model selection, and post-processing techniques.

- Optimization techniques such as reducing false positives, improving tracking accuracy, and real-time processing are essential for deployment.

- Future Enhancements

- Enhancing detection accuracy with fine-tuned models and larger datasets.

- Implementing real-time alert systems for safety violations.

- Deploying these models in edge devices for low-latency processing.

* Conclusion

These projects showcase the power of computer vision in solving real-world challenges. By leveraging deep learning and object detection, we can build intelligent systems for automation, safety, and analytics.
